## Purpose of this repository

This repository was created to practice coding with members of [Software Engineering Association](https://www.swe.or.jp/).
Each directory represents the problem listed on [Leetcode: 60 questions to solve](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/xo2bgr0r/) created by Kohei Arai.
For each problem I make a pull request, in which discussion on my code will be done.
